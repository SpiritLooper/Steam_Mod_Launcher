# Steam Mod Launcher

Run a program both a steam game. Useful to run the mod without thinking to launch it before run your game !

## Description

This project is a simple script Batch. It run your mod then your steam game ! I use this script two times before. 
- For **CSGO** ! I've a Razer Huntsman Keyboard. For lightning effect in my keyboard for this game [GameDog](https://www2.razer.com/chroma-workshop/apps-gamedog) have to launched before CSGO. 
- For **Rocket League** ! Run [Bakkesmod](https://www.bakkesmod.com/) in background when i want to play rocket league. *Mostly see my MMR and use freeplay mod*.

> Lot of times, I ran these games and forgot to run the mod programs before. 
> That's why I wanted to write this script.

## How use it ? 
1. Download `script.cmd`
2. Configure vars :
    - `steam_game_id` : Game id for your steam game. *See on web to know it*.
    - `path_program` : Path of the mod have to launch before steam game.  
    - `exe_name_mod` : Name of file to launch.
    - `steam_path` : Path of the executable steam.
    - `time_sleep` : Time in sec to secure the game's startup after the mod.
3. Let the script in the desktop folder and run it with your mouse !

> I let the script by default for Rocket League game. 

> *Only for Rocket player* :  You have just to change the `path_program` var to configure the script.

## Tip
I change the logo and the name of the script, to make me believe it's always rocket league behind the shortcut.

Enjoy !
